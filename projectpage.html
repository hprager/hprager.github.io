                <p class="paragraphs">
                    For my design project, I decided to come up with a product to help people with vision impairment or blindness get around. I thought of how dangerous it is to be blind, as you could easily run into something and hurt yourself. I decided to build a sensor array that could warn the user of obstacles, by sensing them and playing a sound to tell the user that there is something ahead of them. I thought that the best place to put it would be on a belt, however that ended up posing some problems.
                 
</p>

            <p>
                At first I decided to have only one forward facing sensor, however that wouldn’t be able to protect against anything on the side or behind the person. Also the sensor’s I had have a very limited range, so anything very tall or short would not be detected. For my final design I would have two sensors in the front and the back, that would play different tones, so the user would know which sensor was activated. I also noticed that you would need two of the arrays on either side of you to be fully protected, so the final product would have to be much smaller and less noticeable. Other similar products are very expensive, large, and noticeable and I don’t think that’s necesary. In the final product there would either be more sensors, or the front and back sensors would have a much greater range of detection.

                <p class="paragraphs">
                 Temperature Sensor:
This sensor can measure the ambient temperature, however it seems to be somewhat inaccurate and it takes a long time for it to change values.
I first used the mini lcd screen to display the actual value, and then I used the buzzer, but since the temperature was constant the buzzer didn’t tell me anything.
This type of sensor is used all the time, from  making sure your not sick, to knowing your steak is well done. Digital thermometers are really great because they are very accurate and usually change temperatures immediately (this one didn’t for some reason).
 </p>

<p> Pressure Sensor:
This sensor measures the amount of pressure applied to it. You can squeeze it with your fingers to turn on different things.
I tried to use the lcd screen again, but it changed values so fast you couldn’t really know how exactly how much pressure you were exerting, also I don’t know what the values represented. I also used the fan but it barely slowed down, and it pretty much was either on or off.
Pressure sensors could be used to measure the amount of force needed to do something, like how much force it takes to type on a certain keyboard. Also I think in the new google pixel, you can squeeze the phone to activate the google assistant. 
 </p>

<p> Light Sensor:
This sensor measures the amount of light it sees, however I don’t know what value it measures in.
When I used the lcd screen the value stayed maxed out at 99 even if I covered the sensor. I also tried the fan, but I couldn’t figure out why It wasn’t changing. Apparently if you shine a flashlight at it the value will change, but I didn’t have a chance to do it.
I’m not sure how valuable this sensor could be in the real world, but for any application where something turns on during the day and off during the night, this could be useful. Like with solar panels, you can charge a battery during the day and then automatically start using the battery at night.

                <p class="paragraphs">
                 
                On Google’s AI experiments page I played the Quick! Draw game and the teachable machine. The drawing game was basically like pictionary, where it would tell you what to draw and you would only have 20 seconds to draw it. As you drew the AI would guess what you drew. Since I was playing it on my computer it’s really hard to draw with the trackpad, especially with only 20 seconds. Some of the things it asked to draw were really complicated and hard so the AI couldn’t guess correctly, but simpler things like pants it guessed correctly everytime, and I was pretty impressed. The only problem is that It only knows a certain amount of things that are pre programmed, but it’s still up to the AI to guess what the drawing matches with on it’s list of objects. The teachable machine game was cool as well, because it shows you kindof how the AI learns. Basically you do something like wave to your webcam and assign a picture for the AI to show you when you do that action. It didn’t work that well probably because all the photos had my face in them. </p>

<p> Creating a digital voice was very tedious because you have to read at least 30 sentences to create the voice. Also only 30 sentences is barely enough to make it sound like you and you would probably need to read hundreds of sentences for it to start sounding better. I only used 30 sentences and it didn’t really sound like me. Also I noticed that the shorter the sentence, the less realistic it sounded. If you asked it to only say one word you probably wouldn’t understand what it said. Because of this, I tried having it read me an entire news article. It sounded much better and I could tell behind the robotness it had a tinge of my voice. I thought it was pretty cool, and if I had taken the time to read 200 sentences it would have sounded much better. </p>

<p> I chose to train the Replika chat bot. It first started to ask me some questions to “Get to know me” however  the answers were multiple choice, and if you said something else it would rarely understand. You could ask it simpler questions, that it can understand, but it still didn’t feel like a real person, and the responses it made were to plain and boring to make it feel like it truly knew what I was talking about. </p>

<p> First I asked the assistants where the nearest pizza place was. Alexa gave a long list of pizza places, and said to check the app for addresses. Google told me the address, phone number, and rating of the nearest place, and siri just brought up a search of the same place as google, but it didn’t list the details out loud. All of the assistants listed the same place as the nearest though. Then I asked them what the weather is like. Alexa said there was a high temp of 35 and a low of 20, and it said that we are in East Hampton which is correct. Google said the high was 31 degrees and a low of 21 and it thought we were in Wainscott, which is only about a mile from here. Also both Alexa and Google mentioned that it was snowing, where Siri only said that the weather is bad and

                <p class="paragraphs">
                   On Tuesday the Ilab travelled to NYC to tour NBC studios and Youtube Spaces. We first arrived at NBC Studios in Rockefeller Center. We were early so we spend 30 minuites walking around and looking at the stores. Our tour began at 12:20 and we entered through a strangely hidden door where we signed in on I pads and were checked by security. We were told we couldn't take any photos, but some people ended up doing it anyway. We watched a branded video advertising the coverage of the winter olympics and I knew from there we weren't getting a real exclusive tour unlike at Youtube. It was pretty awesome to see the expensive film equipment and the sets of the countries most popular shows like SNL. I was surprised to see how refined everything was behind the scenes, especially the control rooms and wifi controlled TV walls. The amound of tech in the building was kindof overwhelming expecially with thousands of ethernet cables, managed perfectly, running along the ceiling. The control rooms were completely on display and I think we were viewing the insides through one way mirrors which was pretty interesting. We finally made our way to our own set and we filmed the most awkward news cast in history. I was supposed to be a camera man, but sadly I didn't touch the camera once. I was surprised to see that the fancy camera only had a few controls unlike most high end cinema cameras. I really liked seeing how powerful the company is however it was too structured and you could tell we weren't getting anything that special. After that we got back on the bus and went to Chelsea Market. At first I thought we were getting food first, but actually we were making our way to a hidden elevator made of exposed metal which was already really cool. It already felt like we were getting something exclusive. We entered the reception area and like most tech company offices, it was home to really weird modern furnature. We all signed in on a large touch screen thing which seemed to be custom made. Then our tour guide arrived and he was alot less structured like the people at NBC. I really liked the Youtube tour because it felt less like an advertising ploy. After we checked in, we went to another floor and started looking at the studios, however the coolest thing was that one of my favorite Youtubers just happened to be there. After we saw the studios we entered this another room with VR and other fun tech. The most interesting thing was actually the cameras. We got to see REDs and it was the coolest thing ever. We walked around a bit more, but nothing topped the fact that I got to actually touch a RED. Overall I think youtube was cooler than NBC because it felt less like an everyday tour.

                    For the safari experience I saw the cheetah. It kind of felt like I was there, especially when the cheetah got closer, but VR, especially on phones, is not high enough resolution to seem real. Using the controller helped with the immersion as you could actually select what you are pointing to. </p>

                  <p>  I used the Oculus Rift and the Quill app to try painting in VR. The controls were sortof complicated, but after a couple minutes I figured it all out. It was very similar to the note taking apps on smartphones. The main difference was that you were actually using your hands and the drawing was 3D. I think painting with a drawing tablet or something like that makes more sence because in VR it is really hard to make straight lines and the sortof 3D aspect makes it hard to draw things in consistent distances from the viewer. One advantage could be that the controls were more easily accessible using the touch controllers. </p>

                     <p>I watched a 360 video on the Gear VR of sailing 49ers which are a type of olympic class sailboat. The video had a lot of views from a helicopter, which was super immersive and kind of disorienting. The video was really cool because you could see the boat as if you were the one sailing it. I think it was very immersive because it seemed like you were actually doing something and moving around rather than most videos where the camera is stationary.</p>

                   <p> I think 360 photo and video have great potential to be great especially when paired with VR, because a well shot video on a very high resolution can be very immersive. However 360 video technology is lacking in clarity and seeing the details of the scene are impossible. Because of this, it’s not that immersive.  360 video and photography really makes no sense these days unless you own a VR headset because watching things in 360 by clicking and dragging is really tedious.</p>

                    <p>Google cardboard is the most accessible VR device out of the three. It doesn’t have a controller or even a touchpad, and it is pretty uncomfortable because it’s made of cardboard, has no padding, and doesn’t have a head strap so you have to hold it. Instead of a controller you just look at the thing you want to select and press a button connected to a magnet. The Gear VR is probably the most comfortable because It has just as much padding as the Oculus Rift and it’s lighter. The problem with it is that, without the controller, using the touch pad is super awkward as it has no tactile feedback. Also the controller is hard to use as there is no hand tracking and by moving your hand around normally you could accidentally click on something you didn’t mean to. The oculus has the best all-round experience especially using the touch technology. Having the ability to see and use your hands makes everything so much more immersive, and it allows for many new game ideas. Also the Oculus’ resolution is much better than anything powered by a phone, and the games you can play are much more interesting as it is being powered by a computer.</p>

                    <p>I think VR technology is a great way to train people in fields such as aviation or medicine. VR could be a cheaper way to train people in fields where doing the real thing can be dangerous. With VR there is no need for a huge expensive simulator like the ones at NASA that astronauts train in.  However, VR is still not immersive and cheap enough to make a lot of sense for consumers who just want to play video games.</p>

                <p class="lead">Designing and building a lamp.</p>
                <p class="paragraphs">For the second module of this trimester our class began designing and building lamps. We could use wood, (Mahogany, Cedar, and Poplar) ceramics, and metal. Everyone started by finding pictures of lamps they liked. Then we did a rough sketch of our design, then a full scale sketch with measurements, and finally one sketch in our notebook. Once we had done all three sketches we began building with wood. So far I have finished working with wood and I still have to solder the light and build a base out of metal. I chose a really strange, and contemporary design where the lampshade is suspended on the side of the lamp. I found this design furniture website and I had never seen anything like it. The origional design was completely made of metal where mine is mainly out of wood and it also uses a controllable LED light. So far I have learned alot about fine woodworking and the actually very complicated process of gluing things together. To build the frame that the lampshade is connected to I had to cut 45 degree angles on both sides of each piece of wood. I had to cut it many times because the angles were always slightly off. I also had trouble gluing and nailing the frame together because the peices would move when I tried to hammer in the nails. Once I accisentally cut a peice in the wrong place and I had to make a new one. In fine woodworking you have to hide everything like wires and screws and I learned that I could cut a slot in my peice to run a wire and then make an insert that fits perfectly in the slot to hide it. This project is really fun and I actually really like my lamp and the way its coming.

                <p class="lead"> The Prusa is Finished!</p>
                <p class="paragraphs">A couple weeks ago me and Cameron finished the printer. Building it was fairly easy, except when we made a couple mistakes, but overall it was a really good experience. It took about 2 weeks to build, but thats only because we only had arount 45 minuites a day to work on it. When we first powered it on the LCD screen wasn't working, however we eventually figured out that the cables were reversed. Then we Calibrated the printer which took about 2 classes of work, since the nossle was too low to the heated bed. One of the first prints we did (shown above) came out great, but after a couple prints something became misalighned. Because of this we couldn't use the printer for two days but I eventually fixed it. I also designed a headphone cable holder and printed it, but it took 3 different tries to get it to work well (I didn't measure). Now that its finished I am working on a cutting board and for the second module, a lamp. I have also gone to one of the biggest regattas in the country, and I am coming closer to my goals.

                <p class="lead"> Ilab/ Sailing Update </p>
                <p class="paragraphs">This Year I have joined the Innovation Lab program for 9th grade. Before I talk about that, I will give an update on my previous project. At the end of last year I took the plane out without the gopro attached. Sadly an elevator malfunction caused the plane to crash. The elevator control reversed so up became down and down became up. Because of that I didn't realise I was sending the plane straight towards the ground until it was too late. I started to fix the plane with my friend Cameron but we were unable to finish before the end of the school year. I think I might have time to fix it now that I'm in the official I lab program but I'm not sure.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraphs">Over the summer I continued to sail, but this time offshore, and inshore with some of the best sailors in the world. For two months I sailed out of <a href="https://www.oakcliffsailing.org/"> Oakcliff</a> in Oyster Bay, NY. Oakcliff is a US sailing team training center  and I went there to learn from the best in the sport. For my first month I sailed offshore to Newport, and then to Boston. From Boston I sailed in the Marblehead to Halifax ocean race which covers about 360 miles from Marblehead, Massachusets to Halifax, Nova Scotia. After the race was over we stayed in Halifax for a couple days before overnighting in newport and returning to Oyster Bay. For the next month I did the inshore program where I learned to Match Race, which is the style of racing found in the America's Cup. We learned from an America's cup coach and a national champion, as well as the talented Oakcliff staff. When I finally got home I soon traveled to New Jersey where I sailed in the New Jersey State Championships, coming top 20 out of 130 in two races. Overall my summer was the best yet and It really helped feel like my goals were achieveable. Soon I will be doing the New York State Championships and the East Coast Championships as well as the Orange Bowl (hopefully Irma didn't destroy Miami too bad). I can't wait to do more Regattas and get even better. </p>

                <p class="paragraphs">Luckily I was able to join Ilab and I am continuing this website as a part of our first Module which is coding. Througout the year we will use these Modules like different Units in normal school. My current project is putting together a <a href="http://shop.prusa3d.com/en/3d-printers/59-original-prusa-i3-mk2-kit.html"> Prusa i3 MK 2S 3D printer </a> which the Ilab bought for this year. Cameron is also in Ilab and he is helping to. At this time I have almost completed the Y axis and buildplate which is shown in the picture above. As well as doing new projects I will be revamping this website as well. I am very excited to take part in this program and build more awesome projects. I will continue this blog throughout the year, documenting all the projects that I do.

                <p class="lead">This is a summary of my two projects for Field Academy.</p>
                <p class="paragraphs">For the Innovation Lab field academy we had to come up with a project. Since I really love remote control planes, cinematography, and other tech such as robotics I used those intrests for my projects. I saw that the I-lab had a <a href="https://hobbyking.com/en_us/hobbykingtm-bixlertm-v1-1-epo-1400mm-arf.html">plane</a>, and I realized it was missing alot of parts and needed some repairing. Also I have wanted to take some aerial photography, so I want to incorperate that in too. So far I have designed a GoPro mount for the front of the plane and will be 3D printing it soon. Also I have ordered the parts needed, like a reciver, carbon fiber spar, clevis horns, and battery, and have also repaired the damage. Since I love flying RC planes I wanted to practice on this plane and also experience the Ross campus from above. The only thing that isn't really interesting about this project is that I have flown RC planes before and people have already made camera mounts for this plane before too. It is nice that the mount will be 3D printed and that I designed it. To finish this project I need to design the 3D printed GoPro mount, get the parts needed for the plane, put it all together, make sure the GoPro is secure, and fly successfully above the tennis center. Hopefully I get some good footage of the field and the tennis center.</p>

                <p class="paragraphs">My next project proposal is to program the mBot to follow a maze using the line following sensor, and maybe even building the search and rescue robot too. I have always been interested in robotics so this should be pretty cool. I might use the Arduino programming language to make it more of a challenge but if I don't have time I will have to just use the scratch based program. My goal for this project is to learn more about the arduino programming language and to get more comfortable with robotics. For this project I don't need to buy anything online since the Innovation Lab already has everything I need. All I need to do is download the mBlock program, build the maze, and program since the robot is already set up with the ultrasonic and line following sensors. If I create the search and rescue robot I will also need to attach the mini gripper, and motion sensor to the robot. Hopefully I will get this to work and emulate an actual search and rescue scenario.</p>

                <p class="lead">This morning in Innovation Lab we did a Design Thinking Activity to help us understand how our projects might be structured. </p>
                <p class="paragraphs">First we were given 3 different cards. On the big one was pictures of our person, on the next was what problem our design should solve, and on the third was some questions to help us think of a design. The person I got was a spy, and the problem was to figure out a place for her to sleep. On the third card the questions were about how we should design something to fit the type of person we got.</p>

                <p class="paragraphs">Since my person was a spy I knew that they would be in danger alot, so I designed a bulletproof sleeping bag. At first I designed it to have adaptive camouflage to blend in with all surroundings, bulletproof, light weight, and to have pockets to store things. After I came up with that we got with a partner and suggested ideas to each other to improve our designs. After the discussion I made it foldable and gave it an emergency oxygen tank.</p>
                
                <p class="paragraphs">After that we presented what we came up with and it was cool to see all the weird ideas we came up with in only 20 minutes. This was the second most fun morning activity for me.</p>

                <p class="lead">Yesterday in Innovation Lab the class did a technology immersion workshop to learn about the new tech in the lab, and to give us ideas for our projects. We also had to answer questions about the tech and post the answers to our blogs.</p>
                <p class="paragraphs">The first station that my group encountered was working with the littleBits. The littleBits are magnetically connected electonic modules that can be used to make awesome things, especially when using sensors that read temperature or detect motion. The littleBits are powered by a nine volt battery that is connected to another littleBit in order to power the rest in the chain through the magnets. One of the coolest sensors was the temperature sensor. If you connect it to another littleBit that has a display you can read the temperature. If you connect the power supply to the meter you can read the voltage as well. Another cool sensor was the touch sensor. By connecting that to a led light, you could just touch the sensor to turn it on, however you have to hold it to keep it on. One cool idea I had was to connect the motion sensor to the buzzer to make a motion activated alarm, that is really annoying! The littleBits are a really cool way to create things quickly, easily, and simply using electronics.</p>

                <p class="paragraphs">The next station was the soldering and solar station. We made solar powered roaches that move (more like buzz) when exposed to the sun. We had to solder the buzzer motor to the solar panel and then hot glue the paperclip legs onto the panel as well. When exposed to the sun the motor vibrates the legs causing the roach to move. The soldering was kindof hard because there were no helping hands to hold the motor in place, and to keep things from moving around. It was cool to use solar power but it did not give off enough power to the motor to really get it to move, so I think a battery would be a more advisable power source. Also you could use the solar panel to charge the battery to have an excess supply of power. Also for fun we glued bobly eyes and a fake wire antenna to the roach too. It was pretty fun especially since I like building things, but since I had soldered before I would have liked something more complicated.</p>
                
                <p class="paragraphs">The next station we went to was the virtual reality and 360 media station. First we watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_XPYtyiMWE">360 degree video</a> of swimming with dolphins with the google cardboard. It was pretty cool and definately immersive, but the resolution was not great because 360 video is kindof a new technology. After that we used the 360 degree camera, but sadly it only worked for like five minuites before it's wifi connection cut out. 360 pictures are really cool, but everything is a bit distorted, so it doesnt really capture the real experience compared to normal pictures, but since its immersive it makes up for that. I think it is a great technology for taking panarama shots of nature and landscapes or pretty much any exciting event. Then with the Oculus Rift we played the First Contact game which teaches you how to use Occulus Touch, a hand tracking experience which allows you to see and use your actual hands in the virtual world! There was a big difference between Google Cardboard and the Oculus, especially because the resolution was better and you could actually pick things up and see your hands. Because of that it was much more immersive than the cardboard, making you sometimes forget where you are, constantly switching between the virtual world and the real world. By being able to use your hands it made it feel even more like you are actually there and that you are interacting with your environment, even though the only thing you were actually touching was the controller. By using VR gaming is more immersive and it could be used to train people like pilots how to fly, safer and more immersively than a simulator on a computer. I think VR is an awesome technology, I just hope that AR takes off too. </p>
                
                <p class="paragraphs">The next station was the robotics station. The coolest robot was NAO, an extremely advanced and expensive humanoid robot. Sadly, even though it looked cool, it didn't interact with humans as well as I thought it would especially for its price. It took a long time to recognise the commands it could do and it only could understand a couple things. Even when I tried to program it only two functions seemed to work. However when refined more it could become extremely useful as some sort of servant or helper for humans. Another robot was Cosmo. It was kindof like a little tank with a face, which made it very interactive even though it couldn't speak. You could play some cool games with it and control and view it's camera wirelessly. Cosmo could be very helpful to keep kids occupied or if using the tank tracks and wireless contol and camera it could become a military robot to be deployed into dangerous areas for recon. Another robot was a bartending robot, but we did not get it to work. it was kindof like a car with two wheels in the back and two conected together for steering in the front. The last robot was the Kamigami. It was a bug like robot that could be wirelessly controled to run around and it was made mostly out of paper! However one charge only lasted like five minuites and I didn't get to play with it since it was charging. Obviously we have a long way to go with robotics for consumers, but it is promising, with robots like NAO and Cosmo being available. </p>
