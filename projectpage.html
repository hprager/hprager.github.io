                <p class="lead"> Ilab/ Sailing Update </p>
                <p class="paragraphs">This Year I have joined the Innovation Lab program for 9th grade. Before I talk about that, I will give an update on my previous project. At the end of last year I took the plane out without the gopro attached. Sadly an elevator malfunction caused the plane to crash. The elevator control reversed so up became down and down became up. Because of that I didn't realise I was sending the plane straight towards the ground until it was too late. I started to fix the plane with my friend Cameron but we were unable to finish before the end of the school year. I think I might have time to fix it now that I'm in the official I lab program but I'm not sure.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraphs">Over the summer I continued to sail, but this time offshore, and inshore with some of the best sailors in the world. For two months I sailed out of <a href="https://www.oakcliffsailing.org/"> Oakcliff</a> in Oyster Bay, NY. Oakcliff is a US sailing team training center  and I went there to learn from the best in the sport. For my first month I sailed offshore to Newport, and then to Boston. From Boston I sailed in the Marblehead to Halifax ocean race which covers about 360 miles from Marblehead, Massachusets to Halifax, Nova Scotia. After the race was over we stayed in Halifax for a couple days before overnighting in newport and returning to Oyster Bay. For the next month I did the inshore program where I learned to Match Race, which is the style of racing found in the America's Cup. We learned from an America's cup coach and a national champion, as well as the talented Oakcliff staff. When I finally got home I soon traveled to New Jersey where I sailed in the New Jersey State Championships, coming top 20 out of 130 in two races. Overall my summer was the best yet and It really helped feel like my goals were achieveable. Soon I will be doing the New York State Championships and the East Coast Championships as well as the Orange Bowl (hopefully Irma didn't destroy Miami too bad). I can't wait to do more Regattas and get even better. </p>

                <p class="paragraphs">Luckily I was able to join Ilab and I am continuing this website as a part of our first Module which is coding. Througout the year we will use these Modules like different Units in normal school. My current project is putting together a <a href="http://shop.prusa3d.com/en/3d-printers/59-original-prusa-i3-mk2-kit.html"> Prusa i3 MK 2S 3D printer </a> which the Ilab bought for this year. Cameron is also in Ilab and he is helping to. At this time I have almost completed the Y axis and buildplate which is shown in the picture above. As well as doing new projects I will be revamping this website as well. I am very excited to take part in this program and build more awesome projects. I will continue this blog throughout the year, documenting all the projects that I do.

                <p class="lead">This is a summary of my two projects for Field Academy.</p>
                <p class="paragraphs">For the Innovation Lab field academy we had to come up with a project. Since I really love remote control planes, cinematography, and other tech such as robotics I used those intrests for my projects. I saw that the I-lab had a <a href="https://hobbyking.com/en_us/hobbykingtm-bixlertm-v1-1-epo-1400mm-arf.html">plane</a>, and I realized it was missing alot of parts and needed some repairing. Also I have wanted to take some aerial photography, so I want to incorperate that in too. So far I have designed a GoPro mount for the front of the plane and will be 3D printing it soon. Also I have ordered the parts needed, like a reciver, carbon fiber spar, clevis horns, and battery, and have also repaired the damage. Since I love flying RC planes I wanted to practice on this plane and also experience the Ross campus from above. The only thing that isn't really interesting about this project is that I have flown RC planes before and people have already made camera mounts for this plane before too. It is nice that the mount will be 3D printed and that I designed it. To finish this project I need to design the 3D printed GoPro mount, get the parts needed for the plane, put it all together, make sure the GoPro is secure, and fly successfully above the tennis center. Hopefully I get some good footage of the field and the tennis center.</p>

                <p class="paragraphs">My next project proposal is to program the mBot to follow a maze using the line following sensor, and maybe even building the search and rescue robot too. I have always been interested in robotics so this should be pretty cool. I might use the Arduino programming language to make it more of a challenge but if I don't have time I will have to just use the scratch based program. My goal for this project is to learn more about the arduino programming language and to get more comfortable with robotics. For this project I don't need to buy anything online since the Innovation Lab already has everything I need. All I need to do is download the mBlock program, build the maze, and program since the robot is already set up with the ultrasonic and line following sensors. If I create the search and rescue robot I will also need to attach the mini gripper, and motion sensor to the robot. Hopefully I will get this to work and emulate an actual search and rescue scenario.</p>

                <p class="lead">This morning in Innovation Lab we did a Design Thinking Activity to help us understand how our projects might be structured. </p>
                <p class="paragraphs">First we were given 3 different cards. On the big one was pictures of our person, on the next was what problem our design should solve, and on the third was some questions to help us think of a design. The person I got was a spy, and the problem was to figure out a place for her to sleep. On the third card the questions were about how we should design something to fit the type of person we got.</p>

                <p class="paragraphs">Since my person was a spy I knew that they would be in danger alot, so I designed a bulletproof sleeping bag. At first I designed it to have adaptive camouflage to blend in with all surroundings, bulletproof, light weight, and to have pockets to store things. After I came up with that we got with a partner and suggested ideas to each other to improve our designs. After the discussion I made it foldable and gave it an emergency oxygen tank.</p>
                
                <p class="paragraphs">After that we presented what we came up with and it was cool to see all the weird ideas we came up with in only 20 minutes. This was the second most fun morning activity for me.</p>

                <p class="lead">Yesterday in Innovation Lab the class did a technology immersion workshop to learn about the new tech in the lab, and to give us ideas for our projects. We also had to answer questions about the tech and post the answers to our blogs.</p>
                <p class="paragraphs">The first station that my group encountered was working with the littleBits. The littleBits are magnetically connected electonic modules that can be used to make awesome things, especially when using sensors that read temperature or detect motion. The littleBits are powered by a nine volt battery that is connected to another littleBit in order to power the rest in the chain through the magnets. One of the coolest sensors was the temperature sensor. If you connect it to another littleBit that has a display you can read the temperature. If you connect the power supply to the meter you can read the voltage as well. Another cool sensor was the touch sensor. By connecting that to a led light, you could just touch the sensor to turn it on, however you have to hold it to keep it on. One cool idea I had was to connect the motion sensor to the buzzer to make a motion activated alarm, that is really annoying! The littleBits are a really cool way to create things quickly, easily, and simply using electronics.</p>

                <p class="paragraphs">The next station was the soldering and solar station. We made solar powered roaches that move (more like buzz) when exposed to the sun. We had to solder the buzzer motor to the solar panel and then hot glue the paperclip legs onto the panel as well. When exposed to the sun the motor vibrates the legs causing the roach to move. The soldering was kindof hard because there were no helping hands to hold the motor in place, and to keep things from moving around. It was cool to use solar power but it did not give off enough power to the motor to really get it to move, so I think a battery would be a more advisable power source. Also you could use the solar panel to charge the battery to have an excess supply of power. Also for fun we glued bobly eyes and a fake wire antenna to the roach too. It was pretty fun especially since I like building things, but since I had soldered before I would have liked something more complicated.</p>
                
                <p class="paragraphs">The next station we went to was the virtual reality and 360 media station. First we watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_XPYtyiMWE">360 degree video</a> of swimming with dolphins with the google cardboard. It was pretty cool and definately immersive, but the resolution was not great because 360 video is kindof a new technology. After that we used the 360 degree camera, but sadly it only worked for like five minuites before it's wifi connection cut out. 360 pictures are really cool, but everything is a bit distorted, so it doesnt really capture the real experience compared to normal pictures, but since its immersive it makes up for that. I think it is a great technology for taking panarama shots of nature and landscapes or pretty much any exciting event. Then with the Oculus Rift we played the First Contact game which teaches you how to use Occulus Touch, a hand tracking experience which allows you to see and use your actual hands in the virtual world! There was a big difference between Google Cardboard and the Oculus, especially because the resolution was better and you could actually pick things up and see your hands. Because of that it was much more immersive than the cardboard, making you sometimes forget where you are, constantly switching between the virtual world and the real world. By being able to use your hands it made it feel even more like you are actually there and that you are interacting with your environment, even though the only thing you were actually touching was the controller. By using VR gaming is more immersive and it could be used to train people like pilots how to fly, safer and more immersively than a simulator on a computer. I think VR is an awesome technology, I just hope that AR takes off too. </p>
                
                <p class="paragraphs">The next station was the robotics station. The coolest robot was NAO, an extremely advanced and expensive humanoid robot. Sadly, even though it looked cool, it didn't interact with humans as well as I thought it would especially for its price. It took a long time to recognise the commands it could do and it only could understand a couple things. Even when I tried to program it only two functions seemed to work. However when refined more it could become extremely useful as some sort of servant or helper for humans. Another robot was Cosmo. It was kindof like a little tank with a face, which made it very interactive even though it couldn't speak. You could play some cool games with it and control and view it's camera wirelessly. Cosmo could be very helpful to keep kids occupied or if using the tank tracks and wireless contol and camera it could become a military robot to be deployed into dangerous areas for recon. Another robot was a bartending robot, but we did not get it to work. it was kindof like a car with two wheels in the back and two conected together for steering in the front. The last robot was the Kamigami. It was a bug like robot that could be wirelessly controled to run around and it was made mostly out of paper! However one charge only lasted like five minuites and I didn't get to play with it since it was charging. Obviously we have a long way to go with robotics for consumers, but it is promising, with robots like NAO and Cosmo being available. </p>
